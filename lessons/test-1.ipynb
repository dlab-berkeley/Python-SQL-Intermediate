    "## Introduction to Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Window Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are a powerful feature of SQL that perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is different from regular aggregate functions that group rows into a single output row.\n",
    "\n",
    "With window functions, you can:\n",
    "- Calculate running totals, moving averages, and cumulative distributions\n",
    "- Rank items within groups or across the entire dataset\n",
    "- Access values from previous or subsequent rows alongside the current row\n",
    "- Compute percentiles and other statistical measures within partitions of your data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Window Functions Valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: They allow complex calculations without multiple self-joins or subqueries\n",
    "2. **Expressiveness**: They make it easier to express certain analytical queries\n",
    "3. **Performance**: They can be more performant than equivalent queries using joins or subqueries\n",
    "4. **Readability**: They often make SQL code more readable and maintainable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Analysis**: Calculate month-over-month changes, running balances, and rolling averages\n",
    "- **Sales Analysis**: Identify top products by category, track cumulative sales, and compare to previous periods\n",
    "- **User Analytics**: Analyze user engagement over time, and identify behavior patterns\n",
    "- **Scientific Research**: Perform moving calculations on time-series data\n",
    "- **Data Visualization**: Prepare data for visualization with ranks, percentiles, and relative metrics"

    "## Window Function Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of a window function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2,\n",
    "       WINDOW_FUNCTION() OVER ([PARTITION BY column3] [ORDER BY column4] [frame_clause])\n",
    "FROM table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **WINDOW_FUNCTION()**: The function to apply (SUM, AVG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OVER clause**: Defines the window or set of rows the function operates on\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PARTITION BY** (optional): Divides the rows into groups or partitions. The window function is applied to each partition separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ORDER BY** (optional): Defines the order in which rows are processed within each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Frame clause** (optional): Specifies which rows to include in the window relative to the current row (e.g., ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions generally fall into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregate Window Functions**\n",
    "   - SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()\n",
    "   - These are standard aggregate functions used with the OVER clause\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ranking Window Functions**\n",
    "   - ROW_NUMBER(): Unique sequential integer for each row\n",
    "   - RANK(): Rank with gaps for ties\n",
    "   - DENSE_RANK(): Rank without gaps for ties\n",
    "   - NTILE(n): Divides rows into n roughly equal groups\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Value Window Functions**\n",
    "   - LEAD(): Access data from subsequent rows\n",
    "   - LAG(): Access data from previous rows\n",
    "   - FIRST_VALUE(): First value in the window\n",
    "   - LAST_VALUE(): Last value in the window"

    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Row Preservation**:\n",
    "   - GROUP BY: Collapses rows into a single row per group\n",
    "   - Window Functions: Preserves all rows, adding calculated values as new columns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access to Individual Values**:\n",
    "   - GROUP BY: Loses access to individual row values within each group\n",
    "   - Window Functions: Maintains access to all individual values alongside aggregated results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Aggregations**:\n",
    "   - GROUP BY: Can perform multiple aggregations but still only returns one row per group\n",
    "   - Window Functions: Can compute multiple aggregations alongside individual row data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complex Calculations**:\n",
    "   - GROUP BY: For calculations involving individual and aggregate values, you'd need subqueries or self-joins\n",
    "   - Window Functions: Can directly compare individual values to aggregated results in a single query\n",
    "\n",
    "üîî **Question**: Can you think of a situation where you'd prefer a GROUP BY over a window function?"

    "### Key Differences Between Ranking Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ROW_NUMBER()**:\n",
    "   - Assigns a unique, sequential integer to each row\n",
    "   - Even for rows with identical values, assigns different numbers\n",
    "   - Always gives you consecutive numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RANK()**:\n",
    "   - Assigns the same rank to rows with identical values\n",
    "   - Skips the next rank(s) after ties\n",
    "   - May result in gaps (1, 1, 3, 4, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DENSE_RANK()**:\n",
    "   - Assigns the same rank to rows with identical values\n",
